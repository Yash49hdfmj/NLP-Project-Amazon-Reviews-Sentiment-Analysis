## Introduction  
The primary goal of this project is to analyze customer sentiments based on textual reviews. Sentiment analysis helps businesses understand customer feedback, improving product and service quality.  

---

## Features  
- Preprocessing of raw textual data (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization).  
- Feature extraction using techniques such as TF-IDF or Word2Vec.  
- Training sentiment classification models using supervised learning techniques.  
- Evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core programming language for analysis and modeling.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computation.  
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For text preprocessing and natural language processing tasks.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling and evaluation.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.  

---

## Data Overview  
The dataset comprises reviews of Amazon's fine food products, including textual reviews, ratings, and metadata. Key fields include:  
- `Text`: The actual review provided by the user.  
- `Score`: A numerical rating (used for sentiment classification).  
- `Summary`: A short summary of the review.  

---

## Stepwise Approach  

1. **Data Exploration**:  
   - Import the dataset and explore its structure.  
   - Handle missing values and identify patterns in the data.  

2. **Text Preprocessing**:  
   - Clean the reviews (remove HTML tags, special characters, etc.).  
   - Tokenize text into words.  
   - Remove stopwords and perform stemming or lemmatization.  

3. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Convert textual data into numerical features using techniques like:  
     - Bag of Words (BoW).  
     - TF-IDF.  
     - Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).  

4. **Model Training**:  
   - Split the dataset into training and test sets.  
   - Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM.  

5. **Evaluation**:  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like:  
     - Accuracy  
     - Precision  
     - Recall  
     - F1-Score  
   - Analyze confusion matrix for deeper insights.  

6. **Visualization and Insights**:  
   - Visualize data distribution, word frequency, and model performance.
